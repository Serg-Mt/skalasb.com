title: "Claims handling"

The placement of a contract does not mean our services have ended.

We accompany the contract from the moment of quotation to its completion, including claims
handling.

Skala Reinsurance Brokers Ltd is actively working with Reinsurers to settle claims, protecting
the interests of the Reinsured. Working on behalf of the Reinsured, we assist with collecting the
complete set of documents. Depending on the nature of the event, we orient our client in which
instances it is necessary to apply in order to receive the necessary documents.
