Transportation of goods by sea, rail, road, air transport, as well as the use of pipeline transport requires
in-depth knowledge of the specifics of each type.

The insurer can be a manufacturer, importer / exporter, logistics companies, as well as distributors of
goods.

The transported cargo can be oil and oil products, pharmaceutical products, bulk cargoes (coal, ore,
sand, pebbles, liquid cargoes), steel and metal products, machinery and equipment, goods in barrels and
bags, perishable goods, especially valuable goods, especially dangerous cargoes, etc.

It is necessary to correctly determine the period and scope of coverage - whether it will include loading
and unloading, or responsibility for the cargo comes after loading.

The broker SKALA will guide you on all the fine points of the coverage of this type in order to align
optimal protection and conclude reinsurance contracts.
