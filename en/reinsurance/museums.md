SKALA offers reinsurance placements of museum exhibits.

This coverage covers works of art, historical artifacts, exhibited or located in museums or art galleries.

Coverage is applied both to museums and to individual exhibition collections that move around different
sites.

The policyholder may be the owner of the objects or the museum / gallery where the objects are stored
or the exhibition takes place.
