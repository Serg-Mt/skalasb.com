Catastrophic coverage is used to protect the entire insurance portfolio from risks that have occurred due
to natural phenomena.

Catastrophic Excess of Loss reinsurance protection (CAT XL) will help to avoid accumulation in case of
multiple losses as a result of a single event.

Such events include natural disasters such as earthquakes, tremors, volcanic explosions, floods,
hurricanes, hail, storm, avalanches, forest fires, etc.

CAT XL is a must in regions with high seismic risk, as well as in countries where the state does not
provide financial assistance to victims of natural phenomena.
