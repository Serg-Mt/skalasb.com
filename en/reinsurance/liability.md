SKALA places general third party liability and professional liability in reinsurance.

Liability insurance protects the Policyholder against third party claims. Claims may be brought against
both personal injury and property damage.

Professional liability insurance protects certain professions from legal claims.

Representatives of the following professions are most at risk: doctors (surgeons, dentists), lawyers
(lawyers, notaries, judges), pharmacists, insurance and stock brokers, employees of financial institutions
(auditors, accountants), designers and architects.
